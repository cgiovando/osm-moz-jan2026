## Overview

In January 2026, severe flooding affected over 600,000 people in Mozambique, with Gaza, Sofala, and Maputo provinces hit hardest. This visualization shows the rapid coordinated mapping response by the OpenStreetMap community.

### Key Statistics

- **13,295** peak day edits (January 25, 2026)
- Date range: December 29, 2025 to January 28, 2026

## Features

- **Interactive Timeline**: Click on any day to filter features mapped on that date
- **Layer Toggles**: Show/hide buildings, highways, waterways, and HOT project boundaries
- **HOT Project Boundaries**: Overlay of Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team Tasking Manager projects
- **Data Downloads**: Download GeoJSON and JSON data directly from the interface

## Data Sources

- **OSM Features**: Extracted via [Overpass API](https://overpass-api.de/) with contribution metadata (timestamps, users, changesets)
