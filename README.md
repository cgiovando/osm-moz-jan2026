# Mozambique Flood Response - OSM Mapping Visualization

Interactive visualization of coordinated OpenStreetMap mapping efforts in response to the January 2026 Mozambique floods.

## Live Demo

**[View the interactive map](https://cgiovando.github.io/osm-moz-jan2026/)**

## Overview

In January 2026, severe flooding affected over 600,000 people in Mozambique, with Gaza, Sofala, and Maputo provinces hit hardest. This visualization shows the rapid coordinated mapping response by the OpenStreetMap community.

### Key Statistics

- **50,836** features mapped
- **228** contributors
- **13,052** peak day edits (January 25, 2026)
- Date range: January 23-28, 2026 (flood response period)

## Features

- **Hourly Timeline**: Detailed bar chart showing mapping activity by hour with day separators
- **Animated Playback**: Watch the mapping effort unfold over time with new features flashing yellow as they appear
- **Zoom-Adaptive Buildings**: Buildings shown as dots at low zoom, detailed polygons at high zoom - visible at all zoom levels
- **Layer Toggles**: Show/hide buildings, highways, waterways, and HOT project boundaries
- **HOT Project Boundaries**: Overlay of Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team Tasking Manager projects
- **Data Downloads**: Download GeoJSON, PMTiles, and JSON data directly from the interface
- **URL Hash**: Shareable URLs with zoom/lat/lng parameters

## Technology

- **[MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/)**: Open-source map rendering
- **[PMTiles](https://github.com/protomaps/PMTiles)**: Efficient single-file tile archive format
- **[CARTO Dark Basemap](https://carto.com/basemaps/)**: Background map tiles

## Data Sources

- **OSM Features**: Extracted via [Overpass API](https://overpass-api.de/) with contribution metadata (timestamps, users, changesets)
- **HOT Projects**: Fetched from [HOT Tasking Manager API](https://tasks.hotosm.org/)

| Project | Name | Priority | Progress |
|---------|------|----------|----------|
| [#39738](https://tasks.hotosm.org/projects/39738) | Mozambique Floods, Chicumbane | URGENT | 99% mapped |
